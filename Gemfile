# Noib Notes:

#        I think a good first step would be to make a few very simple Rails apps. Use the Hartl book and the Rails guides as references, shoot me an email if you're stuck for more than 20-30 minutes.

# Task: build a basic bookmarker

# Make a new Rails app that allows a user to manage a list of bookmarks. The root path should take the user to an 'index' page that displays a list of all the links added so far. 

# From the index, the user should be able to click a button 'New Bookmark' that takes them to a page where they can fill out a form to add a new link and an optional name for that link (the URL itself should be required though). If the user attempts to create a new link without a URL, the form should be re-rendered with a helpful error message set using the flash. 

# The user should also be able to delete any given link from the index page as well.

# Note: Rails has a CLI command for generating most of this functionality automatically called 'scaffold'. Feel free to take a look at what it does, but do not use it. Write the code to implement this on your own.
